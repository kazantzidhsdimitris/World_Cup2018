# World_Cup2018
I found a csv.file with all the results in international football since 1872 and I started to experiment with the data.

I downloaded the file from Kaggle.com ,under the name "International football results from  1872 to 2018".

In both projects,I need to filter the data so I could keep only the results for World Cups.

In the file "WC_tot&avg" I counted the total goals in every game and then I found the mean and total goals in every World Cup from 1994 since 2014.At the end, I created 2 graphs,one for total goals in World Cups and one for the average goals.

In the file "World_Cup_project" I calculated the percentages of winning,losing and drawing for 5 teams(Germany,Argentina,Brazil,Portugal,Spain) and created 3 graphs for each outcome.
